# Escape Room Puzzle

An escape room style game where the player interacts with the environment using a 'grabbing' system to move around objects and escape the room!

## Tech

`Unreal Engine`, `C++`

## Motive

I've been a fan of escape rooms ever since I was a child. So I decided to bring this experience to an online game! This project is also intended to help me learn Unreal Engine and C++ along the way.

## Development 

Developed by myself. Utilizes C++ code in Unreal Engine along with the visual scripting Blueprint system to build the game. The C++ code can be found in the `Source/EscapeRoom` folder.
